# Interactive Mutation Browser

## About

Protein Language Models (PLMs) are emerging as a category of [Foundation Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models) in the life sciences.
While there has been a lot of creative exploration of new ways to interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), the application space of PLMs remains underexplored.
This project is an effort to research a new type of PLM interaction: **interactive mutation browsing**.
